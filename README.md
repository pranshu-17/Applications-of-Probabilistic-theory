# Application of Probabilistic Theory

This repository contains the project I completed on the **Applications of Probabilistic Theory**. The project focuses on applying advanced probabilistic models to solve real-world problems, optimize decision-making, and enhance predictive accuracy.

## Features

- **Probabilistic Models**: Implemented various probabilistic models to tackle uncertainty and improve predictions.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzed datasets using probabilistic methods to extract meaningful insights and identify trends.
- **Risk Assessment**: Developed strategies for managing risks by applying probability theory.
- **Optimization**: Used probabilistic algorithms to optimize processes and reduce error rates in predictive systems.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the datasets used for analysis.
- `models/`: Includes the probabilistic models implemented during the project.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
- `results/`: Outputs and visualizations generated from the models.
